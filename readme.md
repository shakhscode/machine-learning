<h2 align="left"> Machine Learning Repository </h2>

Hello! I am happy that you are here :)

- In this repository I pushed all my codes and files for machine learning dummy projects from my local repository.

- You can access the files and if there is any mistake let me know. I am ready to adapt any change/modification. Feel free to send me a pull request.



<h2 align="left">Contents of the Repository </h2>
The repository contains several subfolders. Each subfolder is dedicated for a particular machine learning algorithm. Each subfolder contains mainly following files.

1. A readme file (basictheory.ipynb or readme.md) about basic theory of the particular algorithm.

2. The selected dataset.

3. A _.ipynb (Jupyter notebook) file for exploratory data analysis on the selected dataset.

4. A _.ipynb file for applying the machine learning algorithm either from scratch and/or using sklearn library. 

5. Related text/pictures/graphs/visualization etc.



## Algorithms covered

[1. Linear Regression](/linear-regression/readme.md)

2. Logistic Regression.
