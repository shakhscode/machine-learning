<h2 align="left"> Machine Learning Practices </h2>

Hello! Nice to see you!
In this repository I pushed all my codes I wrote for machine learning practices. I am open to adapt and change/modification/suggestion. Feel free to send a pull request.



<h2 align="left">Contents of the Repository </h2>
The repository contains several subfolders. Each subfolder contains mainly 5 types of files.

1. The selected dataset.

2. A _.ipynb (Jupyter notebook) file for exploratory data analysis on the selected dataset.

3. A _.ipynb file where I created the model from scratch.

4. A _.ipynb file where I applied the created model and the same ML algorithm using sklearn library. Also  contains other validation and evaluation techniques.

5. Related text/pictures/graphs/visualization files.
